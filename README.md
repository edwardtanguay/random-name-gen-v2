# The Ultimate FBW-WD-D07 Student-Name-Generator 3000 v2&trade; &copy;!

Just a fun little project made with the intention that our teachers can randomly generate the name of a student of our class 'FBW-WD-D07', to make it easier to choose who should present the current assignment or answer a question.
[See v1 here]()

## How it works

You press the Button 'It's Generate-Time!' and you'll see a totally random Name from the list of student names of the class. It's random, so it can happen that a name shows up a couple of times.

I also added a reset button called 'I want a clean slate' which simply reloads the page to get rid of the name

And that's it!

### Credit where credit's due:

Big shoutout to [Ali](https://github.com/aliho3ein) for creating the better code and also to [Edward](https://github.com/edwardtanguay) for helping me understand what all that code does!

v3 will come eventually, new and improved, but this time I'll hopefully be far enough into JS to write everything myself!
